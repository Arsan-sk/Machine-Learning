# 📂 Supervised Learning Algorithms

## 🧠 Overview
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions. The model is trained on input-output pairs, where the desired output (label) is known. This directory contains implementations of various supervised learning algorithms.

## 📄 Algorithm Documentation

For detailed information about each algorithm, please refer to the README files in the respective directories:

- [Linear Regression](./Linear%20Regression/README.md): Predicts continuous values based on input features
- [K-Nearest Neighbors](./Kneighbours%20Classification/README.md): Classifies data points based on the majority class of their k nearest neighbors
- [Support Vector Machine](./Support%20Vector%20Machine%20%5BSVM%5D/README.md): Creates a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes for classification

## 🔍 Key Differences Between Algorithms

| Algorithm | Type | Use Case | Strengths | Limitations |
|-----------|------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Linear Regression | Regression | Predicting continuous values | Simple, interpretable | Assumes linear relationship |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | Classification | Pattern recognition, recommendation systems | Simple, non-parametric, adaptable | Computationally expensive for large datasets |
| Support Vector Machine | Classification | Text categorization, image classification | Effective in high-dimensional spaces | Can be memory-intensive |

## 😎 Fun Fact
Supervised learning is like learning with a teacher. The algorithm is given the "correct answers" (labels) during training, and it learns to predict the answers for new, unseen data. This is similar to how students learn from examples provided by a teacher before taking a test on new material!
