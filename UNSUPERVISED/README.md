# 📂 Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

## 🧠 Overview
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, there are no explicit target variables or labels to predict. Instead, the algorithm identifies inherent structures or patterns in the input data. This directory contains implementations of various unsupervised learning algorithms.

- [K-Means Clustering](./k-means-clusturing.py): Groups similar data points into clusters based on their feature similarity

## 🔍 Key Characteristics of Unsupervised Learning

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Input Data | Unlabeled data with no predefined target variables |
| Goal | Discover inherent patterns, structures, or relationships in data |
| Evaluation | More challenging to evaluate as there's no ground truth to compare against |
| Applications | Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, feature learning, dimensionality reduction |

## 🔄 Comparison with Supervised Learning

| Aspect | Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Data | Labeled data with input-output pairs | Unlabeled data with only inputs |
| Task | Prediction or classification based on labels | Pattern discovery without labels |
| Feedback | Clear feedback based on prediction accuracy | No direct feedback mechanism |
| Complexity | Generally simpler to understand and implement | Often more complex conceptually |
| Examples | Linear Regression, SVM, KNN | K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA |

## 😎 Fun Fact
Unsupervised learning is often compared to how a child learns to categorize objects without explicit instructions. For example, a child might group toys by color, size, or shape without being told these are the correct categories - they discover these patterns naturally through observation, just as unsupervised algorithms discover patterns in data!
