## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run these implementations, you need to have the following libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Running the Examples
Navigate to the specific algorithm directory and run the Python script:
```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

## 😎 Fun Fact
Did you know that the term "machine learning" was coined by Arthur Samuel in 1959? He defined it as a "field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." Today, machine learning powers everything from recommendation systems to self-driving cars!
